The **Brazilian Conference on Software: Practice and Theory (CBSoft)** is an event annually promoted by the Brazilian Computing Society (SBC) aiming at fostering the exchange of experience among researchers and practitioners from industry and academia about the most recent research, tendencies, and theoretical and practical innovations on software. Held since 2010 as an aggregating conference of Brazilian symposia promoted by SBC on software, CBSoft has become one of the main conferences of the Brazilian scientific community on Computing.

I (Adolfo Neto) am serving as Publicity Chair (helped by Ema Miranda) for CBSoft 2025.
