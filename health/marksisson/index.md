## Mark's Sprinting Workout


{% include youtube.html id="gXMyl7kw1gY" %}

### Gemini Summary 

Mark Sisson explains his personal sprinting routine, highlighting sprinting as an incredibly effective exercise for getting lean ("cuts you up") and a fundamental part of his "Primal Blueprint" approach to fitness.

He emphasizes the importance of warming up properly (10-15 minutes) before sprinting to prevent injury. While sprints can be done on various equipment or surfaces, he prefers doing them barefoot on a flat, packed beach at low tide, finding the sand forgiving.

**Mark's Specific Sprint Workout:**

- **Warm-up:** 10-15 minutes, including dynamic movements.
    
- **Sprints:** 8 repetitions of approximately 30-second efforts. Each sprint is structured progressively:
    
    - 10 "easy strides" (building pace)
        
    - 10 "medium strides" (increasing intensity)
        
    - 20 "all-out strides" (maximum effort sprint)
        
    
- **Rest:** 30 to 60 seconds of rest between each sprint repetition.
    
- **Cool-down:** Light movement and stretching (quad stretches, air squats, hanging stretch are shown/mentioned) to aid recovery.
    

Sisson notes that this intense workout only needs to be performed about once a week to reap significant benefits, leaving him feeling sufficiently challenged ("thoroughly knackered") for the day.

## This is Why Mark Sisson Doesn't Eat Salad Anymore

### Gemini Summary 

Based on the video clip, here's why Mark Sisson doesn't eat salad like he used to (specifically his famous "Big Ass Salad" or BAS) and his views on seed oils:

- **Shift in Dietary Focus:** Mark explicitly states he **doesn't do the Big Ass Salad anymore** (8:31). His dietary approach has evolved. He now focuses primarily on getting adequate **high-quality animal protein** (meat, fish, etc.) first, viewing vegetables more as a **"condiment"** rather than the base of the meal (8:34-9:01). This is a reversal of his previous approach where the large salad was the base and meat was the addition.
    
- **Concerns About Seed Oils (Especially in Restaurants):**
    
    - **Restaurant Dressings:** He considers restaurant food a "slippery slope" largely due to the oils used. He highlights that even fancy restaurants often use cheap seed oils (soybean, corn oil) as the primary base for their salad dressings to save money, often adding only a tiny amount of advertised "good" oil like extra virgin olive oil (0:37-0:51).
        
    - **Cooking Oils:** Restaurants frequently use low-quality seed oils for cooking and frying. These oils are often reused extensively, becoming rancidified, oxidized, and potentially containing trans fats (0:51-1:19).
        
    - **Personal Strategy:** To avoid these oils when eating out, he specifically requests salads with only olive oil and vinegar (or makes his own vinaigrette at the table) and asks for other foods to be cooked in butter or olive oil (1:25-2:02).
        
    
- **Deeper Concerns About Seed Oils (Beyond Rancidity):**
    
    - While acknowledging the omega-6/omega-3 imbalance and potential inflammation (3:17), Mark expresses a greater concern about the **inherent instability of polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs)** found in seed oils (3:24-3:40).
        
    - He explains that because these fats aren't easily combusted for energy, the body tends to **incorporate them into cell membranes** and other structures. He views this "insidious" incorporation of potentially unstable fats as a primary problem, potentially affecting cell function (e.g., insulin sensitivity) (3:35-4:09).
        
    
- **View on Plant Foods:** He touches upon the idea (referencing Paul Saladino) that many plants contain anti-nutrients and are naturally bitter, suggesting they might be more like "emergency food" for humans compared to nutrient-dense animal products, reinforcing his shift away from large plant-based salads as the meal's foundation (9:02-9:40).
    

In summary, Mark Sisson stopped prioritizing large salads because his dietary philosophy shifted to focus on animal protein first. His avoidance of typical salads, especially in restaurants, is driven by deep concerns over the widespread use of low-quality, unstable, and potentially rancid/oxidized seed oils in dressings and cooking.
